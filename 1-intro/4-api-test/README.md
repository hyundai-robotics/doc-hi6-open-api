## 1.4 Simple API call without coding

If you use Open API while developing a client application like [previous example code](./3-sample-code/README.md), you can easily call the API without coding.  
Through this calling process, you can check whether the request worked properly and what data is returned in response.  
There are several ways to do this. This section covers two representative ones.

### 1.4.1 Using `postman`

`postman` is a widely used API testing platform around the world.
Postman's `workspace` function enables project-level API testing and history tracking, and is equipped with language-specific code snippets and intuitive UI.
Simple usage instructions can be found in [1.5 Requesting POST in Postman](./5-postman.md/#15-requesting-post-in-postman).

### 1.4.2 Using `Web Browser`

Simple `get` requests can be made easily and quickly through a web browser.  
Additionally, you can use your web browser's extension to directly call `get` requests and other API requests and view the results.  
You can check simple usage instructions in [1.6 Calling API from web browser](./6-web-api-call.md/#16-calling-api-from-web-browser).
